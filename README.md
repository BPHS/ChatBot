AP Java Programming Project 

We are going to work as a team to build our own chatbot!

This project will develop our Java projgramming skills and give you real world experience on team development. Most companies today are looking for programmers who know how to work in a small team environment and can also work with a customer.

This is your first "real world" programming project. Let's see if we can make this work.
